# Oilspill_model

## Introduction

> In this github an oil spill particle dispersion model implemented in Julia, is described. 

> The model is based on a Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm with a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme. It uses ocean currents from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), and winds from the Weather Research and (WRF).

> The model considers eight oil components according to their density, and includes multiple types of oil decay: evaporation,
biodegradation, burning, and gathering.

> Finally, it allows simultaneous modeling of several oil spills at multiple locations.
